                android:text="Khulna is the third-largest city in Bangladesh, after Dhaka and Chittagong. It is the administrative center of the Khulna District and the Khulna Division. Khulna's economy is the third-largest in Bangladesh, contributing $53 billion in gross regional domestic product and $95 billion in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2020. In the 2024 census, the city corporation area (Khulna City and its surrounding areas) had a population of 884,445. \nKhulna is on the Rupsha and Bhairab River, a strategic point in southwestern Bangladesh. It is also a center of Bangladeshi industry, hosting many of the nation's largest companies. It is served by the Port of Mongla, Bangladesh's second-largest seaport. The Khulna River Port is one of the country's oldest and busiest river ports.\n A colonial steamboat service, which includes the Tern, Osrich and Lepcha, operates on the river route to the city. Khulna is considered the gateway to the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger. It is north of the Mosque City of Bagerhat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n History\n\n Khulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga and Samatata. It became a part of the Sena dynasty during the 12th-century reign of Ballala Sena, and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal. During the 14th century, Shamsuddin Firoz Shah was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the city. Muslim settlements increased during the time of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, and many mosques and shrines were established. A Muslim saint, Khan Jahan Ali, acquired a jagir (fiefdom) encompassing a large part of Khulna Division from the king of Gauḍa during the 15th century and renamed the region as Jahanabad. Ali ruled until he died in 1459.\nAfter Ali's death, the city became part of the Bengal Sultanate. During the reign of Daud Khan Karrani in the 16th century, Vikramaditya (one of Karrani's chief ministers) obtained a grant in southern Bengal—including Khulna—when Karrani was fighting the Mughals. Vikramaditya established a sovereign kingdom with its capital at Iswaripur (in present-day Satkhira District). He was succeeded by his son, Pratapaditya, who gained preeminence over the Baro-Bhuyans and controlled southern Bengal. Vikramaditya was defeated by Raja Man Singh I, a Hindu Rajput general of the Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1611.\n Khulna was ruled by autonomous Bengali nawabs until 1793 when the British East India Company abolished nizamat (local rule) and took control of the city. Becoming part of Jessore District in 1842, it became the headquarters of Khulna District (the Khulna and Bagerhat subdivisions of Jessore District, the Satkhira subdivision of 24 Parganas district, and the Sundarbans) in 1882. Khulna had a pouroshava (municipal council) in 1884, which became a municipal corporation in 1984.\n Before 19 August 1947, Khulna District was part of undivided Bengal. Khulna first declared itself as part of India in 1947, and the Indian flag was flown on 15 August. Syed Mohammad Abdul Halim (an official of the Bengali civil service) requested Khulna's inclusion in Pakistan, and the boundary commission declared that the city was part of East Bengal. Sher e Bangla A.K.Fazlul Haq, Muslim League leaders Khan A Sabur, Advocate Hamidul Haq Chowdhury, A. F. M. Abdul Jalil, and Abdul Mojid Khan were also involved in the process.\n Pakistani Eastern Command plan for the defense of East Pakistan from 1967 to 1971 (generic representation—some unit locations not shown)\n During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Pakistan Army created the 314th ad hoc Brigade to hold Khulna.[10] The city's Mukti Bahini fighters were part of sector 8 under the command of Major Abu Osman Chowdhury and, later, under Major Mohammad Abdul Monjur.\n\n Geography \n\n Khulna is Bangladesh's third-largest city, after Dhaka and Chittagong. It is in the southwestern part of the country, on the Rupsha and Bhairab Rivers. Even though the city corporation area is 45.65 square Kilometres, The total city area covers 150.57 square kilometres (58.14 sq mi), and Khulna District covers 4,394.46 square kilometres (1,696.71 sq mi). Khulna is south of Jessore and Narail District, east of Satkhira District, west of Bagerhat and north of the Bay of Bengal. It is part of the Ganges Delta, the world's largest river delta. Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, is in the southern part of the delta. Tidal-flat ecosystems are adjacent to the city. Khulna is in the northern part of the district, and the Mayur River is the western boundary of its metropolitan area.\n\nClimate\n\nIn the Köppen climate classification, Khulna has a tropical wet and dry climate. The city is hot and humid during summer, and pleasantly warm during winter. Khulna is significantly affected by the Monsoon of South Asia. Khulna gets less rainfall than other parts of Bangladesh due to its location and the effects of the Sundarbans south of the city. Its annual average rainfall is 1,878.4 mm (73.95 in)h about 87 percent falling between May and October. Khulna also receives heavy rain from cyclones which form in the Bay of Bengal. The city has an annual average temperature of 26.3 °C (79.3 °F), with monthly averages ranging from 11.4 °C (52.5 °F) on January mornings to 34.6 °C (94.3 °F) during April afternoons."
